# Hardware Configuration

Assuming this is a brand new router, the cards should be configured before we proceed with the peering configuration. If this is already done, you can skip this section.

The card and mda types depend on the variant of the 7750 SR in use. The equipped card and mda types can be seen using the `show card state` command.

Our topology is using a fixed form factor chassis (SR-1-24D) and no hardware configuration is required on this chassis.

For modular systems, the following configuration should be completed to bring up the line card modules. The example config below is for a 7750 SR-2se. Choose the correct card type and level for your chassis.

Configure power modules:

```
/configure chassis router chassis-number 1 power-shelf 1 power-shelf-type ps-a4-shelf-dc
/configure chassis router chassis-number 1 power-shelf 1 power-module 1 power-module-type ps-a-dc-6000
/configure chassis router chassis-number 1 power-shelf 1 power-module 2 power-module-type ps-a-dc-6000
/configure chassis router chassis-number 1 power-shelf 1 power-module 3 power-module-type ps-a-dc-6000
/configure chassis router chassis-number 1 power-shelf 1 power-module 4 power-module-type ps-a-dc-6000
```

Configure fabric cards:

```
/configure sfm 1 sfm-type sfm-2se
/configure sfm 2 sfm-type sfm-2se
/configure sfm 3 sfm-type sfm-2se
/configure sfm 4 sfm-type sfm-2se
```

Configure line card:

```
/configure card 1 card-type xcm-2se
/configure card 1 mda 1 mda-type x2-s36-800g-qsfpdd-12.0t

# On systems with XIOM:
/configure card 1 card-type xcm-2se
/configure card 1 xiom "x1" xiom-type x2-s36-800g-qsfpdd-6.0t
/configure card 1 xiom "x1" mda 1 mda-type m36-800g-qsfpdd
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant hardware show commands.

# Ports and Interfaces

Physical port is configured first following by an interface with an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

Each port is considered as a ‘connector’ and supports breakout. The breakout type used on the connector should be configured first which then unlocks the individual ports in the breakout for configuration.

All ports have an associated port mode. Network facing ports used in the base routing instance should be in 'network' mode (default). Client facing ports used in a service should be in 'access' mode. If a port is both network and client facing, it can be set to 'hybrid' mode. Minimum encap on a hybrid port is dot1q.

In this example, we are configuring the connector to use a 1x100G breakout.

```
/configure port 1/1/c1 admin-state enable
/configure port 1/1/c1 connector breakout c1-100g
/configure port 1/1/c1/1 admin-state enable
/configure port 1/1/c1/1 description "To P1"
```

Below is an example of a client facing port configured as 'access' mode with dot1 encap.

```
/configure port 1/1/c10 admin-state enable
/configure port 1/1/c10 connector breakout c4-10g
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 admin-state enable
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 ethernet mode access
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 ethernet encap-type dot1q
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 ethernet mtu 5000
```    

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant port show commands.

The interface is given a name, IP and associated to a physical port.

```
/configure router "Base" interface "To-P1" port 1/1/c1/1
/configure router "Base" interface "To-P1" ipv4 primary address 172.16.10.0 prefix-length 31
```

The `system` interface is the router's loopback interface (like lo0 or loopback0). The name of this interface cannot be changed. If no explicit `router-id` is configured, the `system` interface IPv4 address is used as the router-id. The `system` interface should be assigned a /32 IP.

```
/configure router "Base" interface "system" ipv4 primary address 10.10.10.1 prefix-length 32
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant interface show commands.

BFD can be enabled under the interface for both IPv4 and IPv6. In SR OS, BFD is enabled once under the interface along with the timers and the state is shared with different protocols running over that interface by enabling `bfd-liveness` under each protocol's context.

```
/configure router "Base" interface "To-P1" ipv4 bfd admin-state enable
```

Enabling BFD state sharing on OSPF:

```
/configure router ospf area 0 interface "To-P1" bfd-liveness remain-down-on-failure true
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant bfd show commands.

# Underlay Routing

## IGP - OSPF

In this example, we are configuring a OSPFv2 neighbor. Port and interface configuration is similar to what is shown in previous section. OSPF is given a higher preference value so that ISIS is preferred in our topology.

For more details on OSPF configuration, visit [SR OS OSPF Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/unicast-routing-protocols/ospf.html).

```
/configure router "Base" ospf 0 admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" ospf 0 preference 20
/configure router "Base" ospf 0 area 0.0.0.0 interface "To-P1" interface-type point-to-point
/configure router "Base" ospf 0 area 0.0.0.0 interface "system" interface-type point-to-point
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant OSPF show commands.

## IGP - IS-IS

In this example, we are configuring the router to be in IS-IS Level 1 and 2 (default). Port and interface configuration is similar to what is shown in previous section.

For more details on IS-IS configuration, visit [SR OS IS-IS Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/unicast-routing-protocols/is-is.html).

```
/configure router "Base" isis 0 admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" isis 0 area-address [49.0000]
/configure router "Base" isis 0 interface "To-P1" interface-type point-to-point
/configure router "Base" isis 0 interface "system" interface-type point-to-point
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant IS-IS show commands.

## BGP

We will be using BGP to advertise VPN-IPv4 address family for VPRN service and EVPN address family for EVPN-MPLS service.

Only PE1 and PE3 will participate in VPRN service.

All 4 PEs will participate in EVPN-MPLS service.

For more details on BGP configuration, visit [SR OS BGP Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/unicast-routing-protocols/bgp.html).

```
/configure router "Base" bgp router-id 10.10.10.1
/configure router "Base" bgp group "pe" peer-as 64500
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.2" group "pe"
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.2" family evpn true
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.3" group "pe"
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.3" family vpn-ipv4 true
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.3" family evpn true
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.4" group "pe"
/configure router "Base" bgp neighbor "10.10.10.4" family evpn true
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant BGP show commands.

# Transport Protocol

## LDP

We will enable LDP to be used as a transport tunnel for services.

For more details on LDP configuration, visit [SR OS LDP Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/mpls/label-distribution-protocol-mpls.html).

```
/configure router "Base" ldp interface-parameters interface "To-P1" ipv4 admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" ldp interface-parameters interface "To-P2" ipv4 admin-state enable
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant LDP show commands.

## RSVP-TE

We will enable RSVP-TE to be used as a transport tunnel for services.

For more details on RSVP configuration, visit [SR OS RSVP Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/mpls/mpls-rsvp.html).

Configure RSVP-TE:

```
/configure router "Base" rsvp admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" rsvp interface "To-P1" { }
/configure router "Base" rsvp interface "To-P2" { }
/configure router "Base" rsvp interface "system" { }
```

Configure MPLS:

```
/configure router "Base" mpls admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" mpls interface "To-P1" { }
/configure router "Base" mpls interface "To-P2" { }
/configure router "Base" mpls interface "system" { }
```

Configure MPLS LSP:

```
/configure router "Base" mpls path "loose" admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" mpls path "loose" hop 1 ip-address 10.10.10.10
/configure router "Base" mpls path "loose" hop 1 type strict
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-to-R3" admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-to-R3" type p2p-rsvp
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-to-R3" to 10.10.10.3
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-to-R3" path-computation-method local-cspf
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-to-R3" { primary "loose" }
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant MPLS/RSVP show commands.

## Segment Routing

In this example, we will configure SR-MPLS over ISIS (SR-ISIS). SR OS also supports SR-OSPF.

For more details on SR-MPLS configuration, visit [SR OS SR Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/segment-routing-pce-user/segment-rout-with-mpls-data-plane-sr-mpls.html).

Configure MPLS label range for Segment Routing:

```
/configure router "Base" mpls-labels sr-labels start 21000
/configure router "Base" mpls-labels sr-labels end 22000
```

Configure Segment Routing for ISIS:

```
/configure router "Base" isis 0 advertise-router-capability as
/configure router "Base" isis 0 traffic-engineering true
/configure router "Base" isis 0 segment-routing admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" isis 0 segment-routing prefix-sid-range global
/configure router "Base" isis 0 interface "system" ipv4-node-sid index 1
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant SR-MPLS show commands.

## SR-TE

Segment Routing - Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) can be used to build LSPs similar to RSVP-TE.

For more details on SR-TE configuration, visit [SR OS SR-TE Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/segment-routing-pce-user/segment-rout-with-mpls-data-plane-sr-mpls.html#ai9ekdb660).

In this example, we will configure a SR-TE LSP using loose hops in which case the IGP path will be selected.

```
/configure router "Base" mpls path "loose" admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-sr-te-R3" admin-state enable
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-sr-te-R3" type p2p-sr-te
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-sr-te-R3" to 10.10.10.3
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-sr-te-R3" path-computation-method local-cspf
/configure router "Base" mpls lsp "lsp-sr-te-R3" primary "loose" { }
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant SR-TE show commands.

# ACL

ACL filter policies, also referred to as Access Control Lists (ACLs) or just ‟filters”, are sets of ordered rule entries specifying packet match criteria and actions to be performed to a packet upon a match. Filter policies are created with a unique filter ID and filter name. After the filter policy is created, the policy must then be associated with services.

For more details on ACL, visit [SR OS ACL Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/router-configuration/filter-policies-router-configuration.html).

Refer to the section for each service type for examples on applying ACL to that service type.

Below is an example of a IPv4 ACL.

```
/configure filter ip-filter "Epipe-ACL" filter-id 101
/configure filter ip-filter "Epipe-ACL" entry 10 match protocol icmp
/configure filter ip-filter "Epipe-ACL" entry 10 match dst-ip address 192.168.10.2
/configure filter ip-filter "Epipe-ACL" entry 10 match dst-ip mask 255.255.255.255
/configure filter ip-filter "Epipe-ACL" entry 10 action accept
```

The ACL is applied to the service SAP.

```
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" sap 1/1/c10/1:100 ingress filter ip "Epipe-ACL"
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant ACL show commands.

# QoS

SR OS implements QoS with a 4-step process – Classification, Queueing, Scheduling and (Re)Marking.

QoS policies can be applied under the following contexts:

- SAP Ingress (for traffic ingressing a service)
- SAP Egress (for traffic egressing a service)
- Network Ingress (for traffic ingressing a Network facing port or uplink)
- Network Egress (for traffic egressing a Network facing port or uplink)

For more details on QoS implementation, visit [SR OS QoS Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/aces/sr/25-3/7750-sr/titles/qos.html).

## QoS - Classification

At Service Ingress, Classification is configured in a `sap-ingress` policy.

```
/configure qos sap-ingress "CE-ingress-QoS" dscp cs1 fc "af"
```

The `sap-ingress` policy is applied to the service SAP.

```
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" sap 1/1/c10/1:100 ingress qos sap-ingress policy-name "CE-ingress-QoS"
```

At Network Ingress, Classification is configured in a `network` policy.

```
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" policy-id 10
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" ingress dscp cs1 fc af
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" ingress dscp cs1 profile in
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" ingress lsp-exp 6 fc h1
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" ingress lsp-exp 6 profile in
```

The Network classification policy is applied to the network facing interface.

```
/configure router "Base" interface "To-P1" qos network-policy "Network-QoS"
```

Refer to the section for each service type for examples on applying QoS classification to that service type.

## QoS - Queuing

At Service Ingress, Queuing is configured in a `sap-ingress` policy.

```
/configure qos sap-ingress "CE-ingress-QoS" policy-id 11
/configure qos sap-ingress "CE-ingress-QoS" queue 2 rate pir 100
/configure qos sap-ingress "CE-ingress-QoS" queue 2 rate cir 100
/configure qos sap-ingress "CE-ingress-QoS" fc "af" queue 2
/configure qos sap-ingress "CE-ingress-QoS" fc "af" profile in
```

At Service Egress, Queuing is configured in a `sap-egress` policy.

```
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" policy-id 12
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" queue 3 rate pir 100
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" queue 3 rate cir 100
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" fc be queue 3
```

Both `sap-ingress` and `sap-egress` policies are applied under the service SAP.

```
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" sap 1/1/c10/1:100 ingress qos sap-ingress policy-name "CE-ingress-QoS"
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" sap 1/1/c10/1:100 egress qos sap-egress policy-name "CE-egress-QoS"
```

At Network Ingress and Egress, Queuing is configured in a `network-queue` policy.

```
/configure qos network-queue "Network-queue" fc af queue 3
/configure qos network-queue "Network-queue" fc ef queue 2
/configure qos network-queue "Network-queue" queue 2 rate pir 15
/configure qos network-queue "Network-queue" queue 2 rate cir 10
/configure qos network-queue "Network-queue" queue 3 rate pir 10
/configure qos network-queue "Network-queue" queue 3 rate cir 5
```

For ingress network queueing, the queuing policy is applied under the FP context of the line card.

```
/configure card 1 fp 1 ingress network queue-policy "Peering-Queue"
```

For egress network queuing, the queuing policy is applied under the physical port.

```
/configure port 1/1/c1/1 ethernet network egress queue-policy "Network-queue"
```

## QoS - Scheduling

The example shows a simple port-based scheduler that can be applied to schedule traffic out of a network facing port. SR OS also supports Hierarchical schedulers and Slope policies.

Similar policies can also be applied under a `sap-egress` policy to schedule multiple traffic types at Service egress.

```
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" max-rate 100000000
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 1 rate pir 90
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 1 rate cir 10
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 6 rate pir max
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 6 rate cir max
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 7 rate pir max
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 7 rate cir max
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 8 rate pir max
/configure qos port-scheduler-policy "simple-scheduler" level 8 rate cir max
```

The port based scheduler policy is applied to the physical port.

```
/configure port 1/1/c1/1 ethernet egress port-scheduler-policy policy-name "simple-scheduler"
```

## Qos - Remarking

At Service Egress, remarking is configured in the `sap-egress` policy.

```
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" fc be dscp in-profile cp31
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" fc be dscp out-profile cp31
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" fc af dscp in-profile cs4
/configure qos sap-egress "CE-egress-QoS" fc af dscp out-profile cs4
```

The `sap-egress` policy is applied under the service SAP context.

```
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" sap 1/1/c10/1:100 egress qos sap-egress policy-name "CE-egress-QoS"
```

At Network Egress, remarking is configured in the `network` policy.

```
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" egress fc be lsp-exp-in-profile 0
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" egress fc be lsp-exp-out-profile 0
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" egress fc af dscp-in-profile cs1
/configure qos network "Network-QoS" egress fc h1 lsp-exp-in-profile 6
```

The remarking policy is applied under the interface.

```
/configure router "Base" interface "To-P1" qos network-policy "Network-QoS"
```

Refer to the `show commands` section in this guide for relevant QoS show commands.

# Service Components

A service model in SR OS uses the following logical entities to construct a service.

![image](service-components.jpg)

- Service Access Point (SAP) - identifies the customer facing interface with null, dot1 or qinq encapsulation.

- Service Distribution Point (SDP) - unidirectional transport tunnel that connects services between 2 routers. SDPs can use GRE, LDP, RSVP-TE or Segment Routing tunnels. SDP is independant of service or type of service. Multiple services of same or different type can use the same SDP. In this case, traffic for each service will be separated using a unique `vc-id` defined while attached the SDP to a service.

For services that use BGP for transport signalling (VPRN, EVPN, VPLS), SDP configuration can be replaced by `auto-bind` feature allowing to select from a variety of tunnel types.

## SAP

A Service Access Point (SAP) is a client facing interface and is the ingress point of the packets that will be carried over a service to the remote destination.

To configure a port as a SAP, set the ethernet mode of the port to either `access` or `hybrid`. If required, set the required ethernet encapsulation and MTU.

Note - in `hybrid` mode, minimum encapsulation is dot1q

```
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 admin-state enable
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 ethernet mode access
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 ethernet encap-type dot1q
/configure port 1/1/c10/1 ethernet mtu 5000
```

SAPs are configured within a service configuration context.

```
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" sap 1/1/c10/1:100
```

## SDP

A Service Distribution Point (SDP) is a unidirectional transport tunnel to carry one or more services.

Before configuring a SDP, configure the transport protocol that will be used by SDP - GRE, LDP, RSVP-TE, SR, SR-TE.

SDP is identified by a numerical id.

In this example, we are creating a SDP to PE3 that will use LDP.

```
/configure service sdp 510 admin-state enable
/configure service sdp 510 delivery-type mpls
/configure service sdp 510 ldp true
/configure service sdp 510 far-end ip-address 10.10.10.3
```

The association of the service with the SDP is done under the service context. The SDP id is used along with a unique `vc-id` which is used to identify the service on the remote end. A MPLS label is generated for each unique `vc-id` and is used as the service label in MPLS encapsulation.

```
/configure service epipe "Epipe-VLAN100" spoke-sdp 510:100
```

# Epipe

An Epipe service is a Layer 2 point-to-point service where the customer data is encapsulated and transported across a service provider IP or MPLS network. An Epipe service is completely transparent to the customer data and protocols. The Epipe service does not perform any MAC learning. A local Epipe service consists of two SAPs on the same node, whereas a distributed Epipe service consists of two SAPs on different nodes. SDPs are not used in local Epipe services.

For more details on Epipe, visit [SR OS Epipe Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/layer-2-services-evpn/vll-services.html#ai9emdyvq8).

The epipe topology for this example is shown below:

![image](epipe-topology.jpg)

An Epipe will be created to establish communication between the 2 CE devices. LDP will be used as the tunneling protocol. Refer to `LDP` section in this guide for LDP configuration.

# VPLS

VPLS is a class of virtual private network service that allows the connection of multiple sites in a single bridged domain over a provider-managed IP/MPLS network. The customer sites in a VPLS instance appear to be on the same LAN, regardless of their location. VPLS uses an Ethernet interface on the customer-facing (access) side, which simplifies the LAN/WAN boundary and allows for rapid and flexible service provisioning.

A VPLS service provides connectivity between two or more SAPs on one (which is considered a local service) or more (which is considered a distributed service) service routers. The connection appears to be a bridged domain to the customer sites so protocols, including routing protocols, can traverse the VPLS service.

For more details on VPLS, visit [SR OS VPLS Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/layer-2-services-evpn/virtual-private-lan-service.html).

The vpls topology for this example is shown below:

![image](vpls-topology.jpg)

A VPLS service will be created to establish communication between the 2 clients. RSVP-TE LSP will be used as the tunelling protocol. Refer to `RSVP-TE` section in this guide for relevant LSP configuration.

# VPRN

VPRN (commonly called VRF) is a method of distributing routing information using BGP and MPLS forwarding data to provide a Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) service to end customers

Each Virtual Private Routed Network (VPRN) consists of a set of customer sites connected to one or more PE routers. Each associated PE router maintains a separate IP forwarding table for each VPRN. Additionally, the PE routers exchange the routing information configured or learned from all customer sites via MP-BGP peering. Each route exchanged via the MP-BGP protocol includes a Route Distinguisher (RD), which identifies the VPRN association and handles the possibility of IP address overlap.

For more details on VPRN, visit [SR OS VPRN Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/layer-3-services/vprn-service.html).


The vprn topology for this example is shown below:

![image](vprn-topology.jpg)

Two VPRNs - RED and BLUE will be created on PE1 and PE3 to establish communication between the Clients on either sides. SR-ISIS will be used as the tunneling protocol. Refer to `Segment Routing` section in this guide for SR-ISIS configuration.

The route targets for both VPRNs will be exchanged with each other using route policies so that each VPRN's client is able to reach the other VPRN's client.

# IES

IES is a routed connectivity service where the subscriber communicates with an IP router interface to send and receive Internet traffic. An IES has one or more logical IP routing interfaces, each with a SAP that acts as the access point to the subscriber network.

IES allows IP interfaces to participate in the same routing instance used for service network core routing connectivity. 

For more details on IES, visit [SR OS IES Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/layer-3-services/internet-enhanced-service.html).

The IES topology for this example is shown below:

![image](ies-topology.png)

An IES service will be created to establish communication between the Layer 2 Clients. The routes are exchanged from the global routing table to the IES service. Routed VPLS or rvpls (commonly called IRB) is configured towards the customer to collect the traffic and forward it to the IES service. The rvpls service is configured with a SAP that acts as the access point.

To connect Layer 3 clients, a direct Layer 3 interface can be created facing the Layer 3 client.

# EVPN-MPLS with Multihoming

EVPN is an IETF technology as defined in RFC 7432, BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN, that uses a specific BGP address family and allows VPLS services to be operated as IP-VPNs, where the MAC addresses and the information to set up the flooding trees are distributed by BGP.

EVPN-MPLS is supported where PEs are connected by any type of MPLS tunnel. EVPN-MPLS is generally used as an evolution for VPLS services in the WAN, and Data Center Interconnect is one of the main applications.

EVPN can be used in MPLS networks where PEs are interconnected through any type of tunnel, including RSVP-TE, Segment-Routing TE, LDP, BGP, Segment Routing IS-IS, Segment Routing OSPF, RIB-API, MPLS-forwarding-policy, SR-Policy, or MPLSoUDP. 

For more details on EVPN-MPLS, visit [SR OS EVPN Documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com/sr/25-3/7x50-shared/layer-2-services-evpn/ethernet-virtual-private-networks.html).

The EVPN-MPLS topology for this example is shown below:

![image](l2-evpn-topology.png)

The client on either side is multi-homed to 2 PE devices. An EVPN-MPLS service will be created to establish communication between the Clients. SR-ISIS will be used as the transport protocol. Refer to `Segment Routing` section in this guide for the relevant SR-ISIS configuration.
